# Related Records Data

A record usually contains additional information such as notes, attachments, products, deals, contacts, etc. Using related lists API, you can retrieve all the related list information.

### Get Related Records

#### Purpose

To get the related list records.

#### Endpoints

[GET /{module\_api\_name}/{record\_id}/{related\_list\_api\_name}](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-related-records.html)

### Request Details

#### Request URL

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/{module\_api\_name}/{record\_id}/{related\_list\_api\_name}

#### Supported relations

All modules and their relations are supported. You can use the endpoint in the **href** attribute in the response of the [Related List Meta data API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/related-list-meta.html) to fetch the records from the related lists of a module.

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

If-Modified-Since: Use this header to get the list of recently modified records. Example: 2019-07-25T15:26:49+05:30

#### Scope

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL

(or)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{module\_name}.{operation\_type}

#### Possible module names

leads, accounts, contacts, deals, campaigns, tasks, cases, events, calls, solutions, products, vendors, pricebooks, quotes, salesorders, purchaseorders, invoices, custom, appointments, appointments\_rescheduled\_history, and services.

#### Possible operation types

ALL - Full access to related records

READ - Read related records

#### Parameters

- fieldsstring, mandatory



Specify the API name of the field whose details you want to receive in the response.

- pageinteger, optional



To get the list of records from the respective pages. Default value for page is **1**.

**Possible values:** Positive Integer values only.

- per\_pageinteger, optional



To get the list of records available per page. The default and the maximum possible value is **200**.

**Possible values:** Positive Integer values only.

- page\_tokenstring, mandatory to fetch more than 2000 records by pagination



You can use the "page" param to fetch up to 2000 records without "page\_token". To fetch more than 2000 records, you must include the "page\_token" param in the request. This param takes the value from the key "next\_page\_token" in the response of the first Get Related Records call. Note that this token value is user-specific. If you use another user's token, the system throws an error.

Note that you cannot use this param with the "page" param.

- idsstring, optional



To retrieve specific records based on their unique ID.

**Possible values:** Valid unique IDs of records. Example: 4150868000001944196

- sort\_orderstring



To sort the available list of records in either ascending or descending order.

**Possible values**: **asc** \- ascending order, **desc** \- descending order. The default value is 'desc'.

- sort\_bystring



To sort the records based on the fields **id**, **Created\_Time**, and **Modified\_Time**. The default value is 'id'. Note that you cannot use this param with the "cvid" param.

- convertedstring



To get the list of converted records. Default value is **false**.

**Possible values**: **true** \- get only converted records, **false** \- get only non-converted records, **both** \- get all records.


**Note**

- The **page** and **per\_page** parameter is used to fetch records according to their position in the CRM. Let's assume that the user has to fetch 400 records. The maximum number of records that one can get for an API call is 200. So, for records above the 200th position, they cannot be fetched. By using the page (1 and 2) and per\_page (200) parameter, the user can fetch all 400 records using 2 API calls.
- If the requested related list is not present or hidden in a layout, the system will return an INVALID\_DATA response.
