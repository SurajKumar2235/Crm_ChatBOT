# Blueprint APIs

Zoho CRM's Blueprint is simply an online replica of a business process. It captures every detail of your entire offline process within the software. It facilitates automation, validation, and collaboration of teams, thus making your process more efficient and free from loopholes.

### Get Blueprint Data

#### Purpose

To get the next available transitions for that record, fields available for each transitions, current value of each field, and their validation(if any).

#### Endpoints

[GET /{module\_api\_name}/{record\_id}/actions/blueprint](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/blueprint-details.html)

### Request Details

#### Request URL

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/{module\_api\_name}/{record\_id}/actions/blueprint

#### Supported modules

Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Campaigns, Tasks, Cases, Events, Calls, Solutions, Products, Vendors, Price Books, Quotes, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Custom, Notes, and Activities

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

#### Scope

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL

(or)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{module\_name}.{operation\_type}

#### Possible module names

leads, accounts, contacts, deals, campaigns, tasks, cases, events, calls, solutions, products, vendors, pricebooks, quotes, salesorders, purchaseorders, invoices, custom, notes, and activities

#### Possible operation types

ALL - Full access to records

READ - Get records from a module

Note

- A transition can be either **automatic** or **manual**. In an automatic transition, a record moves to the next stage automatically after the set time period in the current stage has elapsed. The **type** key under **transitions** refers to the type of transition in the current state, while the **type** key under **next\_transitions** represents the transition type in the next transition.
- You can choose the escalation time period for a state. You can perform actions such as sending an email alert, triggering a webhook etc,. once it reaches the escalation time. This time period is defined in the **escalation** key under **process\_info**.
- In a parallel transition, a transition can have multiple child transitions. The parent transition gets completed automatically only when all its child transitions are completed. We will introduce this feature later. Refer to [this announcement](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/topic/parallel-transitions-widgets-support-and-more-a-heads-up-on-upcoming-blueprint-enhancements-3-11-2020) for more details.
