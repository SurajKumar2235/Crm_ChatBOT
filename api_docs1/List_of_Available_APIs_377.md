# List of Available APIs

#### Purpose

To retrieve the list of supported APIs in the current API version, with the option to filter the APIs based on their request methods, OAuth scopes and credit limits.

#### Endpoints

[GET /\_\_apis](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html)

[GET /\_\_apis?filters={value}](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html)

### Request Details

#### Request URL

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/\_\_apis

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

#### Scope

scope = ZohoCRM.apis.READ

#### Parameter

- filtersstring, optional



The parameter allows you to filter the supported APIs for the version specified in the URL. You can filter based on three criteria: **Module**, **OAuth scope**, and **Method**. By default, all supported APIs are displayed for the specified API version.

**{**

**"field": {**

**"api\_name": "{{value}}"**

**},**

**"comparator": "equals",**

**"value": "{{value}}"**

**}**

**Note:** Encode the value of the **filters** parameter before sending a request.



**Example :**_{"field": {"api\_name": "operation\_types.method"},"comparator": "equals","value": "POST"}_

**Explanation :**

It filters only the POST request method APIs, i.e., the value "POST" in the "value" key depends on the value given in the "api\_name" key in the field JSON object.  It filters only the POST request method APIs, i.e., the value "POST" in the "value" key depends on the value given in the "api\_name" key in the field JSON object.

- fieldsJSON object, mandatory



Represents the attribute to filter with.



**Supported attributes  :** Module, OAuth scope, and Request Method.



  - api\_namestring, mandatory



    Represents the API name of the filter to query. Supported filters include:



- [operation\_types.oauth\_scope](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html#oauth) \- to filter OAuth scope-specific available APIs.
- [operation\_types.method](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html#method)\- to filter method-specific supported APIs.
- [module](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html#module)(including [custom module](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html#custom)) \- to filter module-specific supported APIs.

**Note:** Each filter criterion is explained below with a sample request and response.
- comparatorstring, mandatory



Represents the comparison operator used for filtering. Supported value: **equals**.

- valuestring, mandatory



Contains the value to be compared with the corresponding attribute of the " **api\_name**" key in the **field JSON object**.


**Notes**

- Encode the value of the **filters** parameter before sending a request.
- The " **filters"** parameter supports :
  - A **single** criteria.
  - The **"equals"** comparator.
- The API will be supported from version **2**.
- The credit limit for this API is **1**.

#### The "filters" parameter with "OAuth Scope" value

- _**"api\_name": "operation\_types.oauth\_scope"**_



To filter OAuth scope-specific available APIs.



The “ **filters**” parameter structure should be:



filters : {"field": {"api\_name": "operation\_types.oauth\_scope"}, "comparator": "equals" "value": "{{scope\_name}}"}



The supported **scope name values** are settings, modules, users, templates, org, mass\_convert, features, mass\_delete, mass\_update, share, change\_owner, send\_mail, bulk, composite\_requests, notifications, and coql.



To know the **individual module-specific supported APIs**, you can give the value such as "modules.leads", "modules.contacts", and so on.



To know the **individual metadata-specific supported APIs**, you should specify the value as "settings.territories", "settings.custom\_views", "settings.fields", and so on.


#### Sample request using the "filters" parameter to fetch "OAuth scope" related APIs

#### The "filters" parameter with "Module" value

- _**"api\_name": "module"**_



To filter module-specific supported APIs.



The “ **filters**” parameter structure should be:



filters : {"field": {"api\_name": "module"},"comparator": "equals","value": "{{module\_api\_name}}"}



Supported modules are system-defined modules such as **Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Campaigns, Tasks, Cases, Meetings, Calls, Solutions, Products, Vendors, Price Books, Quotes, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Appointments, Appointments Rescheduled History,** and **Services.**


#### The "filters" parameter with "Custom Module" value

- _**"api\_name": "module"**_



To filter available custom module-specific APIs.



The “ **filters**” parameter structure should be:



{"field": {"api\_name": "module"},"comparator": "equals","value": "custom"}



**Supported value:** custom


**Module-specific notes**

- You can specify only the **system-defined** modules.

**Custom module-specific notes**

- The system does not allow directly specifying actual custom module names in the " **value**" key. Instead, use the value **"custom"**. The system will list the available APIs related to custom modules.

The response for a custom module API endpoint looks like : **/crm/{{version}}/{{module}}/actions/add\_tags**. For more samples, refer to the [sample response](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/list-available-rest-apis.html#method:~:text=Contact%20support%20team.-,Sample%20Response,-%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22__apis%22) of the custom module.
