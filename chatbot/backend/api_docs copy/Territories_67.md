# Territories API

Territory management helps you segregate CRM records based on customer attributes such as geography, company size, or industry. This makes it easy to share the relevant records with the right members of your sales team. Territory management allows you to automatically associate Accounts, Contacts, and Deals with territories to maximize revenue.

**Note**

Users with Administrator profile can enable this feature in CRM UI.

#### Key Benefits

- **Avoid complex data-sharing structure** \- Organizations with complex sales structures can use territories to easily share records with users in different teams. It is also convenient to group records based on the account's characteristics rather than the individual ownership of the records.

- **Provide a focused work environment** \- Distribution of customer accounts by using territories help in creating focused work environments that ensures better sales force engagement. It also increases the sales teams' efficiency by reducing the travel time and increasing the industry expertise.

- **Get an accurate evaluation of the sales team's performance** \- Generate sales reports based on territories to evaluate and measure the efficiency of sales teams by territory. Also, get a better insight into the sales contribution of each territory.

- **Forecast sales for each territory and set clear goals** \- Create separate forecast targets for each territory a user belongs to. This will give a clear picture of the goals set for the different territories for users to stay focused.
