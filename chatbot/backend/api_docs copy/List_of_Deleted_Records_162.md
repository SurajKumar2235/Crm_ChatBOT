# Get List of Deleted Records

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/{module\_api\_name}/deleted

#### Supported modules

Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Campaigns, Tasks, Cases, Events, Calls, Solutions, Products, Vendors, Price Books, Quotes, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Custom, Appointments, Appointments Rescheduled History, Services and Activities

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

If-Modified-Since: Use this header to get the list of recently modified records. Example: 2019-07-25T15:26:49+05:30

#### Scope

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL

(or)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{module\_name}.{operation\_type}

#### Possible module names

leads, accounts, contacts, deals, campaigns, tasks, cases, events, calls, solutions, products, vendors, pricebooks, quotes, salesorders, purchaseorders, invoices, custom, appointments, appointments\_rescheduled\_history, services and activities

#### Possible operation types

ALL - Full access to the record

READ - Get records in the module

#### Parameters

- typestring, optional



Specify the type of deleted records you want to retrieve.

**Possible values -**



- **all**: To get the list of all deleted records. This is the **default** value.
- **recycle**: To get the list of deleted records from recycle bin.
- **permanent**: To get the list of permanently deleted records.


- pageinteger, optional



To get the list of records from the respective pages. Default value for page is **1**.

**Possible values:** Positive integers only

- per\_pageinteger, optional



To get the list of records available per page. The default and the maximum possible value is **200**.

**Possible values:** Positive integers only


**Note**

- The **page** and **per\_page** parameter is used to fetch records according to their position in the CRM. Let's assume that the user has to fetch 400 records. The maximum number of records that one can get for an API call is 200. So, for records above the 200th position, they cannot be fetched. By using the page (1, 2) and per\_page (200) parameter, the user can fetch all 400 records using 2 API calls.
- Using this API, you can fetch records that have been temporarily deleted or moved to the recycle bin up to 60 days from the date of deletion. Similarly, records that have been permanently deleted can be retrieved up to 120 days from the date of deletion.
