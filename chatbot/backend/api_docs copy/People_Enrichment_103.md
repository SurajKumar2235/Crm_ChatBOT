# People Enrichment

#### Purpose

Zia enriches data in Zoho CRM based on the data available on the Internet. When you have enabled data enrichment, certain fields act as triggers and enrich data in other fields based on the mapping you have given. For example, if you have set the organization name as one of the trigger fields, then when you enter data to this field while record creation or update, the other fields are enriched based on this.

Personal information enrichment focuses on details related to individuals, such as their job titles, contact details, social media profiles, and professional background. This type of data helps in personalizing outreach and building stronger relationships with contacts.

Use this API to initialize or trigger data enrichment at the people(personal) level. This API schedules a job. Note that an enrichment configuration must be present for the module you want to trigger the enrichment for using this API.

This API is available only in the IN , AU , CA , US , and SA DCs. Note that you must have installed the **Web Amigo** extension from Marketplace to use People Enrichment APIs.
