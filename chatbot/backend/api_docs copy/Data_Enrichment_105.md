# Enrichment Configuration

## Data Enrichment

Zia, Zoho CRM's AI-powered assistant, can help you ensure that your CRM data is complete and updated. Based on information as little as website, name of a company etc., Zia crawls web pages and retrieves additional information such as the company's address, phone, number of employees, the social media handles of the CEO and other public information. This is called Data Enrichment. Refer to [this article](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/zia-artificial-intelligence/data-enrichment-1/articles/zia-data-enrichment#Supported_Modules) for more details.

When you enable Data Enrichment, you can map the data available over the Internet with the fields in Zoho CRM. Data mapping happens by default for system-defined fields, but you can also map with custom fields. This mapping is called configuration.

#### Purpose

Use this API to get the details of configuration for data enrichment. This API gives you the mapping of the enrich fields with their corresponding CRM fields for enriching data.
