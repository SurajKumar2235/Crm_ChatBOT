# Mass Update API

The mass update feature allows you to update the values of specific fields for multiple records in territories or custom views in a module. This API is useful when you want to update the same field for all records in a module, territory, or a custom view.

In this API, the input contains the API names of the fields whose values you want to update, and the record ids, cvids(custom view IDs), or territory\_id.

You can update up to **50,000** (fifty thousand) records using this API.

Mass update of records happens in two ways:

- **Scheduler type**: When you specify custom view ID and territory ID, a job is scheduled in the background and the system returns a "job\_id". Use this job\_id in the GET request to get the result.

- **Non-scheduler type**: When you specify the record IDs, system updates the records instantly. You can update a maximum of 500 records in a single API call in this type of mass update.
