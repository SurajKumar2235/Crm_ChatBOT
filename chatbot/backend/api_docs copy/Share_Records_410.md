ALL - Full access to the record

CREATE - Share records with other users in the organization

**Note**

- The records can be shared to other users in the organization only if certain conditions are met. For simplicity, let us assume that User A shares a record with User B. Now, user A can share the record successfully only if:
  - User B is a **confirmed** and **active** user.
  - User B does not have access to that particular record.
  - User B has access to that particular module. For instance, to share a contact, user B must have access to the Contacts module.
- You cannot share the records in Activities module and Linking module directly. They can be shared as related lists.
- The users who have profiles with **share** permission can share any records that they have access to, except the records that are shared to them. To check the same, go to Setup> Users and Control> Security Control> Choose the profile> Tool Permissions. Check if 'share' is enabled. It is enabled by default for Standard and Administrator Profiles.
- The details of the records that form many to many relationships (with multi-select lookup) cannot be shared.
- A record can be shared only with **10 users**, **5 groups**, and **5 roles**.
- Once the record gets shared successfully, the user who initiated the share operation can be notified via email.
- The user can update the shared records using the PUT method. To know more, refer to [Update Records](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/update-records.html).
