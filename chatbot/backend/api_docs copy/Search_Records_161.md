### Request Details: _criteria_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Request URL:** | {api-domain}/crm/v7/{module\_api\_name}/search?criteria={criteria\_here} |

##### Parameters

- criteriastring



- Performs search by following the shown criteria. **(({api\_name}:{operator}:{value})and/or({api\_name}:{operator}:{value}))**
- You can search for a maximum of 10 criteria (with same or different columns).
- The only operator that is supported for _encrypted fields_ is **equals**.
- When you use **"equals"** in Search API, it behaves like **contains** and fetches the records accordingly. For example, if your condition is (Company:equals: **ABC**), the response will contain records with **ABC** as well as **ABC Inc**(i.e. they contain ABC) in their Company fields. For multiple conditions also, equals operator behaves like contains. For example, if your condition is ​((Company:equals:ABC)and(First\_Name:starts\_with:M)), the response will contain records with first name starting with M and with ABC or ABC Inc in their Company fields.
- The **"in"** operator checks if a value is in a list. If you provide multiple values, the response includes records that match any of them.

For example, (Full\_Name:in:Patricia,Boyle,Kate).
- When you use **parentheses or comma** in the value for a criteria, you must **escape** them using a backslash. Further, you must **encode** the value.
  - Example:

    Consider the search term: ((Last\_Name:equals:Burns,B)and(First\_Name:starts\_with:M))

    After **escaping** comma and parenthesis in the value: ((Last\_Name:equals:Burns\\,B)and(First\_Name:starts\_with:M))

    After **encoding** the value: ((Last\_Name:equals:Burns%5C%2CB)and(First\_Name:starts\_with:M))
- When you use **backslash** as the last character in the value for a criteria, you must escape it using another backslash. Further, you must **encode** the value.
  - Example:

    Consider the search term: (Last\_Name:equals:K\\)

    After **escaping** backslash in the value: (Last\_Name:equals:K\\\)

    After **encoding** the value: (Last\_Name:equals:K%5C%5C)
- The supported data types are **picklist**, **owner\_lookup**, **user\_lookup**, **lookup**, **phone**, **email**, **date**, **datetime**, **text**, **textarea**, **integer**, **currency**, **decimal, multiselectpicklist, bigint, percent, formula, website, boolean** and **double**.
- The supported operators are **equals**, **starts\_with**, **in**, **not\_equal**, **greater\_equal**, **greater\_than**, **less\_equal**, **less\_than** and **between**. Refer to the note section below to learn about the supported operator for each field type.

**Note**

The following section gives you the field types and the operators you can use in the "criteria" parameter

- **Date, DateTime :** equals, not\_equal, greater\_equal, greater\_than, less\_equal, less\_than, between, in.
- **Integer, Currency, Decimal :** equals, not\_equal, greater\_equal, greater\_than, less\_equal, less\_than, between, in.
- **Boolean :** equals, not\_equal.
- **textarea :** equals, not\_equal, starts\_with.
- **Lookup(user/owner) :** equals, not\_equal, in.
- **Picklist, Autonumber :** equals, not\_equal, in.
- **Text, Email, Phone, Website :** equals, not\_equal, starts\_with, in.
- **multiselectpicklist :** equals, not\_equal, in, starts\_with.
- **bigint** **:** equals, not\_equal, greater\_than, greater\_equal, less\_than, less\_equal, between, in.
- **percent :** equals, not\_equal, greater\_than, greater\_equal, less\_than, less\_equal, between, in.
- **formula** **:** The supported operators of the formula datatype will depend on the **return type** of the formula. Please check the corresponding datatype's supported operators.

#### Sample Request: To Search with a Single Criterion

``` curl
Copiedcurl "https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v7/Campaigns/search?criteria=Campaign_Name:equals:CRM&fields=Campaign_Name,Type"
-X GET
-H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.8cb99dxxxxxxxxxxxxx9be93.9b8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxf"
```

**Note**

- Only one of the mandatory parameters (criteria, email, phone, word) would work at one point of time. Furthermore, if two parameters are given simultaneously, preference will be given in the order **criteria, email, phone, and word**, and only one of them would work.
- The **page** and **per\_page** parameter is used to fetch records according to their position in the CRM. Let's assume that the user has to fetch 400 records. The maximum number of records that one can get for an API call is 200. So, for records above the 200th position, they cannot be fetched. By changing the values of the **page** (1, 2) and **per\_page** (200) parameters, the user can fetch all 400 records using 2 API calls.
- You can search for and fetch a maximum of 2000 records using this API. Exceeding this limit throws the "LIMIT\_REACHED" error.
- The value of the fields with sensitive health data will be retrieved **only** when **Restrict Data access through API** option in the compliance settings is **disabled**. If the option is enabled, the value will be **null**. Refer to [HIPAA compliance](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/hipaa-compliance.html) for more details.
- When you create or edit a record, and search for it immediately, you may face the **204 NO CONTENT** error due to a delay in indexing. To fetch records without any delay, use the [Query API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/Get-Records-through-COQL-Query.html).
- The " **in"** operator supports upto **100** values.
- The **"full\_name"** field contains the concatenated values of the **First Name** and **Last Name** fields.

This is a read-only field available only in the Leads, Contacts, and Users modules.
