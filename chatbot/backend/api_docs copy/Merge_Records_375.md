# Merge Records API

This API merges up to three duplicate records into a single one, deleting the duplicates. You can specify one as the master record which is to be retained post-merge, and the other two as child records which are to be deleted. You can specify fields from the child records whose values are to be used for the merged record, and retain the master record values for the remaining fields.

To explore more on the Find and Merge feature, please refer to this [link](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/manage-crm-data/duplication-management/articles/merge-duplicate-record#Find__Merge_Duplicate_Records).

  - api\_namestring, mandatory



    Represents the API name of the file upload or image upload field.

  - \_dataJSON array, optional



    It represents the unique ID of a file or attachment. This field is specifically used for File Upload and Image Upload fields in a record. Use [GET Records API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-records.html) to retrieve the unique IDs of the files or attachments.



    - idstring, mandatory



      Represent the unique ID of the attachment.
- dataJSON array, mandatory



Specify the details of the child records and the fields whose value you want to use in the merged record.



idstring, mandatory



Represents the ID of the child record.



  - \_fieldsJSON array, mandatory



    Specify the API names of the fields whose values you wish to merge into the master record.



    - api\_namestring, mandatory



      Represents the API name of the fields in the child record.

**Notes**

- If an image upload or file upload is not specified, all the images/files in the master record will be retained.
- If **'\_data': null** is provided, all the images/files for that specific field will be deleted.
- If a child record has more than **1000 records** in any of its related lists, then the merge action will be **scheduled**. This meas that it performs an asynchronous action, and the response to your request will not be available immediately. Instead, you will receive a unique **job\_id** in the response. You can use this job\_id to retrieve the status of your merge action. For details, please refer to the [Get Records Merge Status API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-merge-status.html).
