# Scoring Rules API

Zoho CRM provides a system for ranking different records in a module governed by rules that you define based on your specific needs. A record's scoring is a value calculated based on the rules. With this feature, the system assists you in locating the most valuable records.

Multiple scoring rules are not supported in the Standard and Professional editions. Other higher editions allow for 5 active rules for each layout and 5 rules that can run across all layouts. The limitations for various editions are listed below.

#### Supported Editions and Limits:

| Edition | Multiple Layout Support | Active Rules per Module | Total Rules per Module | Number of Criteria per Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard (S) | NO | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| ZohoOne Standard (Y) | NO | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| Professional (P, R) | NO | 1 | 1 | 20 |
| Developer (D) | YES - 2 layouts | 15 | 30 | 5 |
| Enterprise (E, A) | YES - 4 layouts | 25 | 50 | 30 |
| ZohoOne Enterprise (Z) | YES - 4 layouts | 25 | 50 | 30 |
| CrmPlus (C) | YES - 7 layouts | 40 | 80 | 50 |
| Ultimate (U) | YES - 7 layouts | 40 | 80 | 50 |
