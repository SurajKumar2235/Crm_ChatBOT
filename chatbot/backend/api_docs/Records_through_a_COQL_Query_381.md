### Request Details

#### Request URL

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/coql

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtokenÂ d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

#### Scope

scope=ZohoCRM.coql.READ

(and)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{operation\_type}

(or)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{module\_name}.{operation\_type}

**Note:** Use the **ZohoCRM.settings.fields.READ** scope to **retrieve fields metadata**. Without this scope, the system will throw an **OAUTH\_SCOPE\_MISMATCH** error.

#### Possible module names

leads, accounts, contacts, users, deals, campaigns, tasks, cases, events, calls, solutions, products, vendors, pricebooks, quotes, salesorders, purchaseorders, invoices, and custom

#### Possible operation types

ALL - Full data access

READ - Get module data

**Note**

- Although you "get" records from the module, the HTTP method is POST as you "post" the query. Refer to [Query API - An Overview](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/COQL-Overview.html) to learn how to construct a COQL query.
- When you use a module's API name in the query, prefix an **!** to differentiate between a module's and field's API name. For example, _!Leads.Owner.role.id_.
- Encrypted numeric fields support **=**, **!=**, **is null** and **is not null**.
- Encrypted fields are supported in the SELECT column and in the WHERE clause.
- Encrypted non-numeric fields support only **is null** and **is not null**.
- **Tuple** is not supported in COQL.
- The **"full\_name"** field contains the concatenated values of the **First Name** and **Last Name** fields.

This is a read-only field available only in the Leads, Contacts, and Users modules.
- **Formula field:**

To include a formula field in your query, ensure you use only the supported comparators to retrieve information. The available comparators may vary based on the return type of the formula field. The table below outlines the supported comparator based on the return type:



| Formula Field's Return type | Field Data Type<br>supported comparators |
| --- | --- |
| Decimal, Date, DateTime, Number | =, !=, >=, >, <=, <, between, not between, in, not in, is null, is not null |
| String (text) | =, !=, like(used for starts\_with, ends\_with, contains), not like(used for not\_contains), in, not in, is null, is not null |
| Boolean | is null, is not null, equals |


#### Request JSON

- select\_queryJSON key, mandatory



Represents that the input is a select query.


#### Sample Request

CurlDeluge

``` curl
Copiedcurl "https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v7/coql"
-H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.8cb99dxxxxxxxxxxxxx9be93.9b8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxf"
-d "@input.json"
-X POST
```

``` deluge
CopiedqueryMap = Map();
queryMap.put("select_query", "select Last_Name, First_Name, Full_Name from Contacts where Last_Name = 'Boyle' and First_Name is not null limit 2");
response = invokeurl
[\
	url :"https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v7/coql"\
	type :POST\
	parameters: queryMap.toString()\
	connection:"crm_oauth_connection"\
];
info response;
```

In the request, "@input.json" contains the sample input data.

#### Field Types and their Comparators

The following sections describe the field types and their allowed comparators in the COQL query with an example each.

- #### Text, Picklist




**=**, **!=**, **like**(used for starts\_with, ends\_with, contains), **not like**(used for not\_contains), **in**, **not in**, **is null**, **is not null**.


**Note**

The **%** wildcard can be used with the **like** operator to achieve functionalities similar to the **contains, starts\_with,** and **ends\_with** operators. For instance, '%tech' queries for field values ending with 'tech', 'C%' queries for values starting with 'C', and '%tech%' translates to contains 'tech'.

Please note that for the **Not Like** operator, it only works if you give '%' at both ends (not contains). Using '%' only at the beginning (not starting with) or at the end (not ending with) doesn't work.

The valid cases are:

- like "%tech" - ends with 'tech'
- like "%tech%" - contains 'tech'
- like "tech%" - starts with 'tech'
- not like "%tech%" - does not contain 'tech'

#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
 "select_query" : "select Last_Name, First_Name, Full_Name, Lead_Source, Languages_Known
                  from Contacts

}
```

#### Response JSON Keys

- First\_Namestring

- #### Lookup




**=**, **!=**, **in**, **not in**, **is null**, **is not null**.



**Note:** When you query a lookup field, the response only contains the ID of the field. To get the name of the field, you must include the field\_API\_name in the query.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query": "select Last_Name, First_Name, Full_Name, Account_Name
    from Contacts
    where
    ((Last_Name = 'Boyle') and (First_Name is not null)) and (Account_Name.Account_Name = 'Zylker')
    limit 2"
}
```

In this query, the join is established through the lookup field **Account\_Name** in the Contacts module.

### Aggregate Function

You can now use the aggregate functions SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, and COUNT in the select query. The following sections give an example for each of the supported aggregate functions. Note that aggregate functions are case-sensitive.

**Note**

Duplicate aggregate fields in a query will result in a **"DUPLICATE\_DATA"** error in the response.

```
{
"select_query" : "select COUNT(De1), COUNT(De1) from Leads where id is not null"
}
```

- #### SUM




Use this function to sum up the values of an aggregate field in a module. This sample query fetches the total annual revenue generated from the leads whose individual annual revenue is greater than 1000.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query":"select SUM(Annual_Revenue), Company, Last_Name from Leads where Annual_Revenue >= 1000 Group by Company, Last_Name"
}
```

#### Sample Response

``` json
Copied{
    "data": [\
        {\
            "Company": "abc",\

- #### MIN




This function gives the minimum value of an aggregate field. The sample query uses this function to fetch the minimum annual revenue of leads that belong to the Company "ABC".


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query":"select MIN(Annual_Revenue) from Leads where Annual_Revenue != 0"
}
```

#### Sample Response

``` json
Copied{
    "data": [\
        {\
            "MIN(Annual_Revenue)": 100000\
        }\
    ],
    "info": {
        "count": 1,
        "more_records": false
    }
}
```

- #### AVG




Use this function to get the average value of the values of a field. This sample query fetches the average annual revenue generated from the leads.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query":"select AVG(Annual_Revenue) from Leads where Annual_Revenue != 0"
}
```

#### Sample Response

``` json
Copied{
    "data": [\
        {\
            "AVG(Annual_Revenue)": 243333.33333333334\
        }\
    ],
    "info": {
        "count": 1,
        "more_records": false
    }
}
```

- #### COUNT




Use theÂ **COUNT** function to get the number of records that satisfy the criteria in the select query.



The sample query retrieves the count of lead records with annual revenue over **25,000**. The records are grouped based on the lead source using the **group by** clause. For example, you can see that there are two records with annual revenue over 25,000 whose lead source is "Online Store". Similarly, for the lead source "Advertisement", there are two records with annual revenue greater than 25,000.

Note that you can use this aggregate function only for **number**, **lookup**, and **picklist** fields.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
"select_query": "select COUNT(Annual_Revenue), Lead_Source from Leads where Annual_Revenue >25000 group by Lead_Source"
}

```

#### Sample Response

``` json
Copied{
    "data": [\

- ### Consent Lookup




To retrieve information from the **Consent** module via **Consents** **Lookup**, ensure that [GDPR](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/gdpr-introduction#Zoho_as_a_Data_Processor) is enabled and the required modules are properly configured. For more details, refer to the [Consent Managemen](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/consent-management#Best_Practices_for_Consent_Management) t documentation.



**Note:**

Once GDPR is enabled and configured for a module, a new **Data Processing Basis Details field** will be created in the respective module with the data type **consent\_lookup ("data\_type": "consent\_lookup")**. You can retrieve these details using the [GET Fields Metadata API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/field-meta.html). To fetch the **Consents** module's fields, make a [GET Fields Metadata API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/field-meta.html) call to the **Consents** module.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query": "select Data_Processing_Basis_Details.Contact_Through_Email,Data_Processing_Basis_Details.Data_Processing_Basis from Leads where Data_Processing_Basis_Details is not null"

You can use a record image's ID to fetch related data. For example, if you only have a record image's ID and want to retrieve the respective record's last name, you can include the record image ID in your query.



#### Retrieving the Profile Image ID using COQL:



To retrieve the unique IDs of the Record Image field for different records in a module, use the below query:



```
{"select_query": "select Record_Image from Leads where Record_Image is not null"}
```





This will return the Record Image ID for each record in the module.



**Note:**

You can download the image using the [GET - Files API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-files.html) by specifying the profile image field ID, which can be retrieved using the query above.


#### Sample Query

``` json
Copied{
    "select_query": "select Last_Name, Record_Image from Leads where Record_Image in ('siwz79472749456ff433f8b88d0a795ae9855') "
}
```

#### Sample Response

``` json
Copied{
    "data": [\
        {\
            "Record_Image": "siwz79472749456ff433f8b88d0a795ae9855",\
            "Last_Name": "Kitzman",\
            "id": "5725767000000420480"\
        }\
    ],
    "info": {
        "count": 1,
        "more_records": false
    }
}
