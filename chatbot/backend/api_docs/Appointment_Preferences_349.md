Contains the field mappings and layout details for record configuration in the Deals from Appointments module. The key is mandatory when **when\_appointment\_completed:create\_deal**.



- **layout** _(JSON object, mandatory)_ \- Contains the Deals layout ID and name of the layout to which you want to map the appointment fields. You can get these details from [Layouts Metadata](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/layouts-meta.html) API.
- **field\_mappings** _(JSON array, mandatory)_ \- Contain the fields from Deals module which have to be mapped with Appointments and Services module fields to create deals automatically when an application is completed. This field mapping is bounded to the specified layout and you have to create a new field mapping for different layouts. **Deal\_Name, Account\_Name, Closing\_Date, Pipeline and Stage** fields are mandatory for field\_mappings.
  - **field** _(JSON object, mandatory)_ \- Represents the API name and ID of the field present in the Deals module that you want to fill in using the data from the Appointments module. Refer to the [Fields Metadata](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/field-meta.html) API to get the list of fields available in a module. Ensure that you do not feed an invalid field API name or the ID as it will throw an error.
  - **type** _(string, mandatory)_ \- The Deals field can either be merged with the Appointments field or made a static field.

    Possible Values:

  - **value** _(string, mandatory)_ \- Denotes the value of the Deals fields. The value is different for each specified type.

    **Value for merge\_field**: The datatype of this value is a string. To merge any field from a module, it should be specified like this **${module\_api\_name.field\_api\_name}**.

    Example: ${Appointments\_\_s.Appointment\_Name}

    **Value for static**: The datatype of this value is a JSON object. It contains the name and ID of the entity.

    When you want to give static values that look up to a different module, make a GET API call of the specific module and provide the relevant ID and name of the record. You can also give standard text values enclosed in a string.

**Note**

- The system-defined field mappings are specified below. This mapping cannot be changed and it is a read-only field.
  - **Amount** \- The amount field in the Deals module is mapped with the Price field in the Services module.
  - **Closing\_Date** \- The closing date field in the Deals module is mapped with the Appointment\_Start\_Time field in the Appointments module.
- **"when\_duration\_exceeds":"ask\_appointment\_provider\_to\_complete"** is the default Appointment preference for any organization.
- A few fields are given default field mappings and are listed below.
  - **Owner** \- Super admin of the organization.
  - **currency** \- The configured home currency of your organization.
  - **Pipeline** \- The standard pipeline of the specified layout.
  - **Deal\_Name** \- The Appointment\_Name field in the Appointments module.
- The type of 'Owner' field is **static** only when you choose either Super Admin or Users from the picklist. The type should be **merge\_field** for 'Member', 'Appointment created by' and 'Appointment modified by' picklist values.
