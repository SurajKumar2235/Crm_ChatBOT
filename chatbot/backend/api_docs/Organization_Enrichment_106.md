# Organization Enrichment

#### Purpose

Zia enriches data in Zoho CRM based on the data available on the Internet. When you have enabled data enrichment, certain fields act as triggers and enrich data in other fields based on the mapping you have given. For example, if you have set the organization name as one of the trigger fields, then when you enter data to this field while record creation or update, the other fields are enriched based on this.

Use this API to initialize or trigger data enrichment on the org level. This API schedules a job.
