# Insert Records

#### Purpose

To add new entities to a module.

#### Endpoints

[POST /{module\_api\_name}](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/insert-records.html)

### Request Details

#### Request URL

{api-domain}/crm/{version}/{module\_api\_name}

#### Supported modules

Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Campaigns, Tasks, Cases, Meetings, Calls, Solutions, Products, Vendors, Price Books, Quotes, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Appointments, Appointments Rescheduled History, Services and Custom

#### Header

Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken d92d4xxxxxxxxxxxxx15f52

#### Scope

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL

(or)

scope=ZohoCRM.modules.{module\_name}.{operation\_type}

#### Possible module names

leads, accounts, contacts, deals, campaigns, tasks, cases, events, calls, solutions, products, vendors, pricebooks, quotes, salesorders, purchaseorders, invoices, custom, appointments, appointments\_rescheduled\_history, services and notes

#### Possible operation types

ALL - Full access to the record

WRITE - Edit records in the module

CREATE - Create records in the module

**Note**

- To insert a single record, send only one JSON object in the input with the necessary keys and values.
- The 'INVALID\_DATA' error is thrown if the **field value length** is more than the maximum length defined for that field.
- If an API is used inside a Function and the field value length exceeds the limit, then that function receives an error response from the API. For ex: If the max length for a "Text field" is defined as 10, then value given for it in API cannot be "12345678901", as it has 11 characters.
- Duplicates are checked for every insert record API call based on unique fields.
- A maximum of 100 records can be inserted per API call.
- You must use only Field API names in the input. You can obtain the field API names from:
  - [Fields metadata API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/field-meta.html) (the value for the key “api\_name” for every field). (Or)
  - **Setup** \> **Developer Hub** \> **APIs and SDKs** \> **API Names** \> **{{Module}}**. Choose “Fields” from the “Filter By” drop-down.
- The **trigger** input can be **workflow**, **approval**, **blueprint**, **pathfinder**, or **orchestration**(for the Journey Builder feature). If "trigger" is not mentioned, the automation actions related to the API will get executed. Enter the trigger value as \[\] to not execute the workflows.
- Records with **Subform** details can also be inserted to CRM using the Records API. Please look at [Subforms API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/insert-subforms.html) to learn more about adding subform information within a record.
- The **$approved** key is used to create records in the approval mode. It is mostly used for leads and contacts procured from web forms. Specify the value as **false** to create the record in approval mode.
- Multiselect Lookup association is restricted if the dependent record is locked, and the system will throw a **RECORD\_LOCKED** error.
- In calls module, the call duration for an Inbound or Outbound call cannot be zero.

#### Sample Request

``` curl
Copiedcurl "https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v7/Leads"
-H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.8cb99dxxxxxxxxxxxxx9be93.9b8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxf"

Accepts unique ID of the record, which you can get through [Get Records API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-records.html).

**Example:**"Lookup" : {

"id" : "425248000000104001"

}

- UserJSON object



This is a default look-up field to users in Zoho CRM.

**Example:**"User":

{

"name":"Patricia Boyle",

"id":"4150868000000623001"

}

- lar\_idstring



The unique ID of the lead assignment rule you want to trigger while inserting the lead. Use the [Get Assignment Rules API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-assignment-rules.html) to obtain the lar\_id. This key must be given parallel to the key "data".

- LayoutJSON Object



The ID represents the unique ID of the layout. You can get your layout IDs from the [Metadata Layouts API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/layouts-meta.html).





**Note**



- You must provide the layout ID field if you want to
  - include the layout specific mandatory fields in the API-level mandatory check
  - include only the fields that are defined in your layout for API- level processing and ignore the rest

- $wizard\_connection\_pathJSON array



The IDs of the connections in a wizard that indicates the screen traversal when the record is created. Use the IDs in the "connections" key in the "containers" array of the [Get Wizards](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-wizards.html) response.

- Wizardstring



The ID of the wizard in which you want to create the record. Use the Get Wizards API to fetch the ID of the wizard.

- apply\_feature\_executionJSON array



Use this array to apply an existing layout rule when you create a record. Layout rules allow you to show a section, certain fields, set mandatory fields, or show a subform. However, you can only trigger the "Set Mandatory Field" option through the API.

Specify the value **layout\_rules** for the key **name** to apply a layout rule to the record. Note that you must give this key parallel to "data".

Ensure that the input body includes all the keys required to satisfy the criteria in the layout rule. The system throws an error, otherwise. For example, if the layout rule triggers when the Lead\_Source is Employee Referral, and you have mandated the Company field, then the system throws the MANDATORY\_NOT\_FOUND error if you fail to give the Company key in the input.

- skip\_feature\_executionJSON array



By default, if a Cadence is configured for a module, it will be executed automatically when you create a record via API. This key lets you **skip the execution of the Cadences feature** during record creation.

Specify **"cadences"** as the value for the **"name"** key to skip Cadences execution for the record. Ensure you include this key alongside the **"data"** key in your request. The supported value for the **"name"** key is **"cadences"**.

This section explains the input JSON for pipeline, image upload, file upload, multi-select lookup, and multi-user lookup fields in the Deals module.

- Pipelinestring



The name of the Pipeline you want the record to be assigned to. Note that this key is mandatory when a pipeline is enabled for the Deals module. Also, it is mandatory to input the Stage for the deal record. Use the [Get Pipelines API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/get-pipelines.html) to get the name of the pipeline.



In [Layouts metadata API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/layouts-meta.html), the _pick\_list\_values_ inside the _maps_ key represent the stages that are available in the pipeline. You can only add a stage that is available in this list to a deal for that pipeline. The system throws an error otherwise.

- Image\_UploadJSON Array



The API name of the image upload field in a module.



  - File\_Id\_\_sstring, mandatory



    The File\_Id you received in the response when you added the image through the [Files API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/upload-files-to-zfs.html).

    You can add multiple images to the image upload field while inserting a record. Refer to the example on the right pane for the JSON structure.
- File\_UploadJSON Array



The API name of the file upload field in a module.



  - File\_Id\_\_sstring, mandatory



    The file ID you received in the response when you added the file through the [Files API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v7/upload-files-to-zfs.html).

    You can add multiple files to the file upload field while inserting a record. Refer to the example on the right pane for the JSON structure.
- Multi-select lookup



When you create a multi-select lookup field in a parent module to associate multiple records from a child module, a linking module gets created between the parent and the child. In the linking module, this data is arranged as two different lookup fields, one each for the parent and the child. To add values to the multi-select lookup field in the parent module, you must include the child module's lookup field's API name and specify the ID of the record in the child module that you want to associate with the parent.



In this example, **Listings** is a multi-select lookup field in the Deals module (parent module) that associates the records in the Listings module (child module). **Interested\_Listings** is the lookup field in the linking module. Refer to the example in the right pane for the JSON structure.



  - ListingsJSON Array

    Interested\_ListingsJSON Object



    The API name of the lookup field in the linking module.

  - idString



    The unique ID of the record in the child module that you want to associate with the parent module.
- Multi-user lookup



The API name of the multi-user lookup field. Accepts the IDs of the users as individual JSON objects. Refer to the example for the JSON structure.



  - Multi-userJSON Array

    Multi-userJSON Object



    The API name of the multi-user lookup field.

  - idString



    The unique ID of the user you want to associate with the multi-user lookup field.
